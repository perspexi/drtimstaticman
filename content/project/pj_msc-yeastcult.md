Making fuel ethanol from the fibrous sugar based polymers in biomass has long been an aspired industrial process. The main challenge lies in the hydrolysis step to obtain bioavailable sugars. In addition to enzymatic hydrolysis, hydrolysis via acid, heat and pressure, remains an old but viable technology for releasing the sugars.![The wood to ethanol process](/img/wood2ethanol.jpg)In either hydrolysis route, the process parameters must be carefully optimized to yield the critical sugar concentration required to make the ethanol distillation economic.The other problem with acid hydrolysis is that the resulting sugar stream is toxic or inhibitory to most microorganisms. This research discusses the possibility of finding yeast strains, and  modifying bio-process operations to accommodate the acid hydrolysed sugar solution not only as a feedstock for  ethanol fermentation, but also as the growth medium to cultivate the fermentation micro-organism.
