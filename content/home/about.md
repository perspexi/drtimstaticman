I am a Canadian Professional Engineer registered with [Engineers Nova Scotia](https://engineersnovascotia.ca/) and recent PhD graduate from the [Dahn group](https://www.dal.ca/diff/dahn.html) having researched durable fuel cell catalysts. I also have research experience in industrial Yeast bioprocesses (MSc). I have worked as an educator, municipal engineer, and environmental regulator.
