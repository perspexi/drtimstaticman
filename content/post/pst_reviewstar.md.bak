There's no "proper" way to indent. You have to  
$\quad$ hack it. More ways are listed on [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6046263/how-to-indent-a-few-lines-in-markdown-markup)

Symbols
Symbols (c), (tm), and (r)  
HTML symbols can come in handy: &sect; &yen; &cent; &pound; &euro; &curren;  
Some (like the Dutch Florin symbol: &fnof;) may work in older browsers.  
Unicode symbols work too.
¥,£,€,¤,ƒ  
HTML white space: non-breaking_space:(&nbsp;) tab:(&Tab;)  
newline(&NewLine;) does not redder a newline. 
Many more HTML symbols referenced at:
More referenced at [Symbol Codes | Entity Codes for HTML](http://sites.psu.edu/symbolcodes/codehtml/)  
I'm not sure if all are supported by hugo's non-mmark markdown.  
Many of these are not supported by hugo. Maybe they can be enabled but I dont know.

Latex works when "math = true" is added to gohugo page meta data. I think it's rendered by by [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) ([quickref](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference)). Some markdown implementaitons use [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/).  
Inline $y=\text{m}x +\rm{b}$  
centered:
$$ y=\text{m}x +\rm{b} $$

An empty line before a Latex block will add a barely noticeable bit of extra space than no empty line.
