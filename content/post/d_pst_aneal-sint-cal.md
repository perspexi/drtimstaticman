Solid materials change when heated. The change may be crystallographic 1) a phase change (ex CaCO3 calcite and aragonite), 2) grain/crystallite growth, or 3) an ordering change (amorphous to crystaline), or the material may change chemical (reactant(s) to product(s) (generally more exothermic or endothermic than a phase change.

There are several words used to refer to a type of heat treatment.

- calcination: comes from the decomposition of calcium carbonate (limestone) to calcium oxide (lime) and carbon dioxide, in order to produce cement.Generally a gas in evolved.
 - below melting point
- anealing: intended outcome is grain growth.
- sintering: powder particles join at contacting points when heated. occurs in different atmospheres (air, inert gas, H2)
 - below melting point of materials (though there is liquid phase sintering where one of the materials melts. 

 Some authors confuse the use of these terms, while others use them interchangeably.
