Maxwell Plank

I think most would agree, the modern physics revolution began with Plank. He was the first to propose, with an open reluctance, that energy comes in discrete chunks. This was based on his sucessful model for black body radiation. Other (einstien) would later develop this into the theory of photons.

Plank's 1st wife and all his children dies in his life time.
