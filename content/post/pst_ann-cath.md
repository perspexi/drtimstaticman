I've been at this PhD for over a year and I still can't keep anode and cathode straight!

Exploring the etymology should help. It turns out Angilgan priest and theologian William Whewell coined the term cathode. He was consulted by Faraday who needed some new scientific jargon for a paper he was writing. Faraday oriented his cell east/west, so that electrical current leaves the west side because that is where the sun leaves us, in the west. **"Cathode" is Greek for "the way down"**, which is where the sun goes in the west, just like the current in Faraday's electrochemical cell.

One should be aware, this is conventional current leaving the cathode. Electrons are entering the cathode, so cathodic current is an oxidation reaction.
The real story behind the jargon, in liu of some dorky mnemonic, should help me remember. I will consult my priest friends next time I need to make up a new scientific word.
