abstract = "Various amounts of Ir (< 20 µg cm-2) and Ru (up to 12 µg cm-2) on a consistent base Pt loading of 85 µg cm-2, were sputter deposited on a nanostructured thin film catalyst support to mimic a hydrogen fuel cell’s cathode catalyst. The nanostructured support was grown on glassy carbon disks designed for a rotating disk electrode, which was used to simulate what happens to a fuel cell cathode during repeated start-up, operation, and shut-down. The testing protocol subjected the catalyst to a minimum potential of 0.650 VRHE and a maximum between 1.53 and 1.8 VRHE . because tThe upper potential was achieved with a galvanostatic hold -which is an alternative way to simulate potential transients on the cathode caused by start-up and shut-down. Increasing Ir loading improved the durability of both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Ru loadings provided little benefit to OER durability except when combined with 10 µg Ir cm-2 Ir. Ru addition improved the ORR durability compared to pure Pt. ORR durability was not influenced by Ru addition to Ir-containing samples. In general, ORR durability showed no dependence on Ru loading for all the Ru containing samples."

# abstract_short = "Small amounts of either Ir or Ru were added to Pt by either co-sputtering or over-layer sputtering onto 3M Company's NSTF catalyst support. The transient cathode potentials caused by fuel cell start-up, shut-down and operating conditions were simulated with a combination of potentiostatic and galvanostatic holds. All compositions including either Ir or Ru lasted significantly longer than for pure Pt under repeated start-up/shut-down. The stability of the over-layer Ir-Pt compositions was significantly higher than for the co-sputtered deposition."
